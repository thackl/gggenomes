Description: gggenomes is an extension of ggplot2 for creating complex genomic
 maps. It builds on the power of ggplot2 and tidyverse adding new ggplot-style
 geoms & positions and dplyr-style verbs to manipulate the underlying data. It
 implements a layout concept inspired by ggraph and introduces tracks to bring
 tidyness to the mess that is genomics data.
